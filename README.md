## Design

## Shoes microservice

I created a model for Hat based on the specifications I was given. I also created a LocationVO object and built a poll that would gather the locations from the Wardrobe microservice and assign it to that LocationVO. From there I implemented React to make sure I could display that data I created in the backend, and allow my user to manipulate the hat data like creating a hat, and deleting a hat.

## Hats microservice

Explain your models and integration with the wardrobe
microservice, here.
